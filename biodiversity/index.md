* **40% threatened by extinction** of insect species studied (Sánchez-Bayo & al., 2019)

* Insect **biomass, abundance and species number decreased by 67%, 78% and 34%** in German grasslands between 2008 and 2017 (Seibold & al., 2019)

### Factors influencing grassland insect diversity


The decline in insect diversity observed on global {{< cite "Sanchez-Bayo2019" >}} and regional scale {{< cite "Hallmann2017" >}} is a major threat. Besides habitat loss and agricultural intensification is one of the main drivers of insect decline. In addition to social and political pressure, there are ecological and economic reasons for promoting insect diversity in agricultural landscapes. Insects provide important ecosystem services such as pollination, decomposition of organic material or biological pest control and play a central role in the food web of nature, e.g. as food for insectivorous birds. These four ecosystem services provided by insects alone are therefore estimated to be worth US$57 billion per year in the USA (Losey & Vaughan 2006). In a recent study, insect biomass was shown to have declined by 2/3 in grasslands as well

Agri-environmental measures (AES)
{{< style "text-align:justify; strong{color:#00b1ff;}" >}}
For more than three decades, the cultural landscape program (KULAP, “Kulturlandschafts- programm”, StMELF & StMUV 2020) financially supports farmers for environmentally friendly management. KULAP is divided into four main pillars representing climate protection, soil and water protection, biodiversity, and preservation of an attractive cultural landscape. Additionally, the Bavarian contractual nature conservation program (VNP, “Vertragsnaturschutzprogramm”, StMELF & StMUV 2020) preserves and improves ecologically valuable habitats that depend on nature-friendly management. Farmers who voluntarily manage their land in accordance with nature conservation objectives receive appropriate compensation for the additional effort and lost income. VNP implements the Bavarian biodiversity strategy and help to establishing the Natura 2000 European network.

**Aims**
The main objective of this study was to investigate the influence of environmental drivers on grassland insect biomass and diversity. Specifically, we asked
1)   Do AES relate to insect biomass and diversity in grasslands in Bavaria?; and
2)   Do landscape structures, different management strategies and vegetation influence the biomass and diversity of insects?
