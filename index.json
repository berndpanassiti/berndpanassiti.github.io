Tips about algolia You need to upload index.json files to algolia to activate searching. You could upload the index.json files by browsers but a CLI tool may be better. Algolia Atomic is a good choice. To be compatible with Hugo multilingual mode, you need to upload different index.json for each language to the different index of algolia, such as zh-cn/index.json or fr/index.json… ","date":"2020-03-06","objectID":"/examples/theme-documentation-basics/:5:2","tags":["installation","configuration"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Basics","uri":"/examples/theme-documentation-basics/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Find out how to create and organize your content quickly and intuitively in LoveIt theme.","date":"2020-03-05","objectID":"/examples/theme-documentation-content/","tags":["content","Markdown"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Content","uri":"/examples/theme-documentation-content/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Find out how to create and organize your content quickly and intuitively in LoveIt theme.

You can reference page resources by the value for Resources.GetMatch or the filepath of the resource relative to the page directory directly. Store resources in the assets directory, which is /assets by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the assets directory. Store resources in the static directory, which is /static by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the static directory. The priority of references is also in the above order.

Copy-tex Copy-tex is an extension for $ \\KaTeX $. By the extension, when selecting and copying $ \\KaTeX $ rendered elements, copies their $ \\LaTeX $ source to the clipboard. Set the property copyTex = true under [params.math] in your site configuration to enable Copy-tex. Select and copy the formula rendered in the previous section, and you can find that the copied content is the LaTeX source code. mhchem mhchem is an extension for $ \\KaTeX $. By the extension, you can write beautiful chemical equations easily in the article. Set the property mhchem = true under [params.math] in your site configuration to enable mhchem. $$ \\ce{CO2 + C -\u003e 2 CO} $$ $$ \\ce{Hg^2+ -\u003e[I-] HgI2 -\u003e[I-] [Hg^{II}I4]^2-} $$ The rendered output looks like this: $$ \\ce{CO2 + C -\u003e 2 CO} $$ $$ \\ce{Hg^2+ -\u003e[I-] HgI2 -\u003e[I-] [Hg^{II}I4]^2-} $$ ","date":"2020-03-05","objectID":"/examples/theme-documentation-content/:5:2","tags":["content","Markdown"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Content","uri":"/examples/theme-documentation-content/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Ruby Annotation An extended Markdown syntax for ruby annotation is supported in LoveIt theme: [Hugo]^(An open-source static site generator) The rendered output looks like this: HugoAn open-source static site generator ","date":"2020-03-05","objectID":"/examples/theme-documentation-content/:5:3","tags":["content","Markdown"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Content","uri":"/examples/theme-documentation-content/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Fraction An extended Markdown syntax for fraction is supported in LoveIt theme: [Light]/[Dark] [99]/[100] The rendered output looks like this: Light/Dark 90/100 ","date":"2020-03-05","objectID":"/examples/theme-documentation-content/:5:4","tags":["content","Markdown"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Content","uri":"/examples/theme-documentation-content/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Font Awesome LoveIt theme uses Font Awesome as the icon library.

Hugo uses Markdown for its simple content format. However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesn’t support well. You could use pure HTML to expand possibilities. But this happens to be a bad idea. Everyone uses Markdown because it’s pure and simple to read even non-rendered. You should avoid HTML to keep it as simple as possible. To avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes. A shortcode is a simple snippet that can generate reasonable HTML code and conforms to Markdown’s design philosophy. Hugo ships with a set of predefined shortcodes that represent very common usage. These shortcodes are provided for author convenience and to keep your markdown content clean.

Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

Environmental and biological drivers of white plague disease on shallow and mesophotic coral reefs. Ecography. ecog.05527. https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.05527 we studied the coral disease white plague (WP) in the Caribbean Sea, around the US-Virgin Islands. Abstract Outbreaks of coral white plague (WP) disease have caused significant regional declines of reef‐building Caribbean corals. Due to a greater availability of epidemiological data, studies have primarily focused on shallow coral reefs (\u003c 30 m). In the U.S. Virgin Islands, however, WP disease prevalence appears to be higher on upper mesophotic (30–40 m) coral reefs when compared with shallow reefs and may be inhibiting coral recovery after environmental disturbances. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of environmental drivers with spatio‐temporal patterns of WP prevalence across shallow and mesophotic coral reefs in the U.S. Virgin Islands. We recorded WP prevalence at 13 reef sites (five shallow, three mid‐depth and five upper‐mesophotic reefs) across the south shelf of St. Thomas approximately monthly between 2012 and 2015 using a drop camera method. The influence of environmental factors on disease prevalence was investigated using Bayesian inference with generalized linear mixed‐effect models. We found that WP tended to increase during the beginning of the rainy season (June), and when levels of water turbidity and temperature were higher, and levels of oxygen and salinity lower. The disease prevalence was higher on mesophotic than on shallow or mid‐depth reefs, probably due to higher availability of corals (host), and a possible temperature threshold for WP occurrence that allows long‐term persistence (year‐round) of the disease on upper‐mesophotic reefs. This is the first study to implement the drop camera method to survey a coral disease over several reef sites and depths. This method can be applied on surveys of other rapid tissue loss diseases, such as the newly emergent stony‐coral‐tissue‐loss‐disease (SCTLD). We found that WP tended to increase during the beginning of the rainy season (June), and when levels of water turbidity and temperature were higher, and levels of oxygen and salinity lower. The disease prevalence was higher on mesophotic than on shallow or mid‐depth reefs. Whiteplague monitoring (Photo: T.

In addition to social and political pressure, there are ecological and economic reasons for promoting insect diversity in agricultural landscapes. Insects provide important ecosystem services such as pollination, decomposition of organic material or biological pest control and play a central role in the food web of nature, e.g. as food for insectivorous birds. These four ecosystem services provided by insects alone are therefore estimated to be worth US$57 billion per year in the USA (Losey \u0026 Vaughan 2006). In a recent study, insect biomass was shown to have declined by 2/3 in grasslands as well (Citation: Seibold \u0026 al., 2019) Seibold, S., Gossner, M., Simons, N., Blüthgen, N., Müller, J., Ambarlı, D., Ammer, C., Bauhus, J., Fischer, M., Habel, J., Linsenmair, K., Nauss, T., Penone, C., Prati, D., Schall, P., Schulze, E., Vogt, J., Wöllauer, S. \u0026 Weisser, W.

Heattree AUM For more than three decades, the cultural landscape program (KULAP, “Kulturlandschafts- programm”, StMELF \u0026 StMUV 2020) financially supports farmers for environmentally friendly management. KULAP is divided into four main pillars representing climate protection, soil and water protection, biodiversity, and preservation of an attractive cultural landscape. Additionally, the Bavarian contractual nature conservation program (VNP, “Vertragsnaturschutzprogramm”, StMELF \u0026 StMUV 2020) preserves and improves ecologically valuable habitats that depend on nature-friendly management. Farmers who voluntarily manage their land in accordance with nature conservation objectives receive appropriate compensation for the additional effort and lost income. VNP implements the Bavarian biodiversity strategy and help to establishing the Natura 2000 European network. Even though being important instruments towards an environmentally friendly agriculture, both KULAP and VNP measure do not primarily aim to preserve and increase insect biomass and diversity. Aims The main objective of this study was to investigate the influence of environmental drivers on grassland insect biomass and diversity. Specifically, we asked Do agri-environmental measures relate to insect biomass and diversity in grasslands in Bavaria?; and Do landscape structures, different management strategies, weather conditions and vegetation influence the biomass and diversity of insects?

Netherer) Abstract Infestations by the Eurasian spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus have recently caused peaks in Norway spruce mortality in Central European forests. In this study, we examined how temperature conditions, chronic and acute drought stress, and stand characteristics influence forest disturbance by the spruce bark beetle. We investigated bark beetle induced salvage logging in Norway spruce stands of Austrian Federal Forests (ÖBf) as a proxy variable for infestation/attack by I. typographus. Utilizing ÖBf forest inventory data and the monitoring tool PHENIPS-TDEF, a well-proven bark beetle phenology model combined with a forest water balance module, we retrospectively simulated effective temperature sums for bark beetle development and transpiration deficits at forest stand level. We examined forest stand properties and the model output variables as predictors of bark beetle attack in decision trees and binary logistic regression analysis. We found that I. typographus infestation increased with a stand predisposition index indicating high share of Norway spruce, increased stand age, and stand density. Stands subject to bark beetle attack in the previous year were highly prone to subsequent damage, which points to attack pressure from increased population densities due to ample supply of breeding material. While chronically dry soil conditions described as shallow, xeric, and of low moisture, were associated with bark beetle infestation to a lesser degree, acute drought in the form of increases in stand transpiration deficits proved to raise the probability of bark beetle attacks. The previous year’s and current year’s summer (June to August) TDEF total, in combination with effective thermal sums allowing for at least two bark beetle generations and sister broods, were significant predictors of bark beetle attack. We conclude from our results that in the absence of windthrow, a combination of ample host availability, favorable temperature conditions for bark beetle development, and acute disposition of trees to attack caused by drought stress can intensify population growth and very likely lead to bark beetle mass outbreaks.

Find out more how knowledge about such interactions can help to optimize pest management in viticulture… Agriculture faces In our recent paper we studied the coral disease white plague (WP) in the Caribbean Sea, around the US-Virgin Islands. Panassiti2017 Abstract ‘Bois noir’ is a phytoplasma-mediated grapevine yellows disease that causes great economic damage in European vineyards. Previous studies have examined habitat relationships on a regional scale, which help to better understand the large-scale epidemiology. Local drivers, such as micro-habitat preferences of the vector (Hyalesthes obsoletus, a cixiid planthopper), or local interactions with reservoir host plants, however, are still poorly understood, although this knowledge is crucial for developing site-specific management strategies. Here, we examined the local environment-species relationships of a phytoplasma-mediated grapevine disease on a scale of 15 m in a 2.9 ha vineyard using: (i) data on elevation and habitat types; (ii) cover of host plants Urtica dioica and Convolvulus arvensis over three seasons, (iii) vector monitoring over four seasons; (iv) genetic tests for phytoplasma presence in the vector; and (v) inspection of 6056 grapevine plants for visual symptoms of the ‘bois noir’ disease. The data were analyzed in a joint causal model that describes the interplay between vector, pathogen, disease and environment, estimated with Bayesian inference. Our results indicate that surrounding natural and semi-natural vegetation (fallow land, forest and managed agricultural land) and high density of the major host plant U. dioica are associated with an increase in vector population densities. Higher vector population densities at low availability of U. dioica were associated with higher phytoplasma infection rates in the vector. The prevalence of disease symptoms in grapevine plants was nonetheless more affected by grapevine cultivar and higher elevation than by the estimated availability of infected vectors. The results of our local analysis support current bois noir management recommendations stating that (1) removal of the host plant U. dioica should be best carried out in either spring or autumn; and (2) grapevine cultivars are unequally susceptible. Moreover, we provide evidence that U. dioica control before the flight period may result in low U. dioica densities and high H. obsoletus population densities, causing an increase in vector infection rates and disease pressure. Zusammenfassung Die Schwarzholzkrankheit (Bois noir) ist eine durch Phytoplasmen ausgelöste Vergilbungskrankheit auf Reben, welche erhebliche ökonomische Schäden im europäischen Rebbau verursacht. Bisherige epidemiolgische Studien zu den Habitatassoziationen von Bois noir konzentrierten sich auf die regionale Ebene. Lokale Standortfaktoren, wie das vom Überträgerinsekt (Hyalesthes obsoletus, Hemiptera: Cixiidae), bevorzugte Mikroklima oder lokale Interaktionen mit den Wirtspflanzen, wurden bis jetzt kaum untersucht worden. Jedoch sind gerade diese notwendig für die Entwicklung standortspezifischer Bekämpfungsstrategien. Wir untersuchten die kleinräumigen “Umwelt-Art-Beziehungen” dieser Vergilbungskrankheit in einer räumlichen Auflösung von 15 m in einem 2.9 ha großen Rebberg. Dabei verwendeten wir die folgenden Daten: (i) Höhe (m ü. NN) und Landschaftskontext; (ii) Deckungsgrad von den Wirtspflanzen Urtica dioica und Convolvulus arvensis aus drei Jahren; (iii) Gelbfallenfänge von H. obsoletus aus vier Jahren; (iv) molekulare Phytoplasmennachweise in Überträgerinsekten; und (v) Symptomausprägung der Schwarzholzkrankheit auf 6056 bonitierten Rebstöcken.
